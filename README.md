# NutriAssistAI

## Project Overview

NutriAssistAI is a nutrition-focused web app that uses **AI-powered image analysis** to answer food-related questions and offer precise nutritional breakdowns from user-uploaded meal photos.  
Powered by IBM Watsonx Llama-4, this app combines advanced image-to-text generation, custom prompt engineering, and user-friendly response formatting to deliver real-time food education and calorie counting.
